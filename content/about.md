### Welcome! :)

Nice to meet you! I am Tacio. I am a software engineer and architect 
that love delivering great software and making people's lives easier.
I've been working with NodeJS for five years and learning and contributing
to open source projects in Golang, in the last two years.

I recently joined [Delivery Much](https://deliverymuch.com.br)'s tech team as a backend engineer. Previously,
I worked as a software architect, back-end lead, back-end and quality assurance
and even had some devops responsibilities.
Yeah, I know, too many different things. But I have to say that it helped me
to have a broader knowledge about software engineering.

Oh, I forgot to say that I am brazillian, that I have a Bachelor of Computer Science
and that I was a Fifa Pro Player in the past (I can hear you saying that Fifa isn't
even a game). Anyway, let's get to the FAQ section...

### FAQ

#### So you worked in many different things, but what are you focusing on?
Back-end engineering, Golang and building awesome products in tech companies.


#### Tell me more about your Golang experience?
I don't have any professional experience yet. My experience is totally based on open
source contributions. I've been contributing to some great projects like Kubernetes,
Grafana and CoreDNS. I am even doing my own open source project, [Kronos](https://github.com/taciomcosta/kronos).


#### Tell me more about your NodeJS experience?
Well, I've worked in many different products related to monitoring, delivering,
scraping, microservices and monoliths, and I even architected some of them. I used NestJS,
Typescript, integrated many different services and databases.


#### What are your disciplines?
TDD, BDD, Clean Code, Clean Architecture, DDD, Design Patterns, Small Releases
and Refactoring are some of the things in my toolbox. I am also highly inspired by:
