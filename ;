### _Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. - Leonardo da Vinci_

So it's been more than an year since I started to write my first lines of Go code.
It was the end of 2019, I header some rumors about some "Go programming language"
that was hyped, that was backed by Google and that it was different from every other
programming language. 

When you're learning to program and you here things the ones above, you get excited:
yeey a new tool to learn! - or panicked: ooh, no! another thing to learn.
But when you have a few years of experience, you're reaction will look more like:
oh, another couple of people creating things to solve the same problems.
